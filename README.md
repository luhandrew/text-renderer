# About ðŸš€
just a lil custom text renderer

# Photos ðŸ“·
I know the character sizes in the pictures are weird, but I couldn't really get them to look normal.
I'd say that rendering the svg was probably the thoughest part of the project :)

I've had a lot of issues with the sizing: At first I was setting the cells to be a fixed size, but that was just
causing the letters to be squished and would look like the 2nd picture from the JetBrainsMono-Bold test.

So then I thought about making the sizing dynamic, which works better I suppose and it also aligns them up to, it's just
that some are bigger now and some are smaller.

If anyone has a better idea make a pr ig
